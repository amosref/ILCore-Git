I"/<p>Extension: The name of a person’s parent, recorded for administrative purposes as part of the person’s demographics (e.g to help with identification). This SHOULD NOT be confused with a parent whose details are recorded for contact purposes (Patient.contact) or as a family member (RelatedPerson). Most systems will use the “father’s name” field as the source of data for this extension. NOTE: This extension replaces the old ParentName extension and is the PREFFERED extension. Note: there SHOULD be only one parent marked as ‘official’</p>
