I"b<p>A list of value codes for observations for the IL Core</p>

<p>Note: The entire LOINC code system is included in this ValueSet although it should only include LOINC Answers - LOINC codes that start with ‘LA’. Since there is no computable way to define a ValueSet according to the code’s prefix, we rely on an invariant to enforce this rule.</p>
